Authors and commenters type their email addresses in the usual format, but this plugin remove any phone numbers and email addresses from comments. This is usefull when u have a blog with a lot of contacts u don't want to pubblish.

== Description ==

Phone numbers and email addresses will be removed and the privacy will be protected!

This plugin sits snugly inside your WordPress installation and silently but effectively makes it very difficult for spambots to harvest email addresses from your WordPress-powered blog. This is accomplished with a combination of WordPress filter hooks and a little bit of JavaScript.

After installation, visitors to the site will see email addresses and phone numbers 
as a fake email/phone number;

The plugin is active in both the content section _and_ the comments section: if a visitor inadvertently (or intentionally) posts a valid email address in a comment, it will be protected by this plugin as well.

== Installation ==

Unzip the file into your wp-content/plugins directory. In your wp-admin screen, activate the plugin. Easy as pie!

The idea for this plugin came from Allan Odgaard, the developer of the **best text editor on the planet** -- [TextMate](http://www.macromates.com/) -- who had incorporated this functionality into TextMate but expressed a desire on his blog for a WordPress plugin to accomplish this task.
